Maybe wrap macro in <> or ''
'not true' = 'false'

Every = macro is added to compiler dictionary and then the compiler starts a new thread for this new definition that starts reading code from this point along with other routines doing the negex matching
matches for the same code are sent to a channel that stores possible negex free replacements for the same code in the right order.
Phase 2 simply does that search and replace, replacing longer strings first.
