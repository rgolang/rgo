Maybe wrap macro in <> or ''
'not true' = 'false'

Every = macro is added to compiler dictionary and then the compiler starts a new thread for this new definition that starts reading code from this point along with other routines doing the negex matching
matches for the same code are sent to a channel that stores possible negex free replacements for the same code in the right order.
Phase 2 simply does that search and replace, replacing longer strings first.

Explain why ('bool' = 'true|false') uses `|` instead of `/`, because it's way more common in functional programming `haskell` (TODO: Verify); `curry` (TODO: Verify) and `typescript`,`php` and `go` and to use `|` for union. `/` might also be confused with `per` and `or`, also by having `|` be build time, `/` can be for runtime `or`.

TODO:
```rust
bool: true/false

// gets run as possible options:

x bool: true?
x bool: false?

// similar to rust match
x match: 
    true(x) => // run code if true
    false(x) => // run code if false
```
